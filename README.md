## CPA Australia Discussion group: Accounting and Finance Analytics

*************************************

CPA Australia's Accounting / Finance Analytics discussion group is committed to promoting data analytics and business intelligence in the area of accounting and finance. We discuss a range of topics, from the effect of COVID-19 on business to hands-on experience with data analytics software for accounting and finance. We are open to CPA members, but welcome all interested in innovation, data and technology use in the accounting and finance area.

Our meetings are held monthly - last Monday of the month. You can find us [here](https://www.cpaaustralia.com.au/member-services/discussion-groups/victoria#GENERAL)
